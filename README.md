This project fine-tunes a lightweight language model (e.g. `lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5`) to answer clinical yes/no questions about opioid dosing in pain management. It targets GPU-constrained environments (8GB VRAM) using 4-bit quantization, efficient prompt-label alignment, and controlled data augmentation. It leverages the public [Q-Pain dataset from PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/q-pain/1.0.0/) for patient vignettes, drugs, and dosage references.

## üß™ Problem

How to reliably generate yes/no opioid dosage decisions from synthetic clinical vignettes in a pain management context?

---

## Challenges

- **Tiny, imbalanced dataset:** Original dataset has ~50 samples mostly low dosage, no high dosage, few omissions. Originally designed for LLM bias detection, not dosing prediction.
- **Data augmentation:** Needed to create more medically plausible samples without breaking clinical validity.
- **Model selection trade-offs:** Models >7B parameters run too slow on 8GB GPUs. Needed a base model that‚Äôs capable but lightweight and follows instructions precisely, including JSON-formatted output.

## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques

- **4-bit quantization** with `bitsandbytes` enables 7B model inference on limited GPUs.
- **Prompt + label design:**  
  - Concatenate prompt + label + `<eos>` tokens for decoder models.  
  - Use attention masks to exclude prompt and padding from loss calculation.
- **Data pipeline:**  
  - Synthetic vignette generation with control over pain severity and diagnoses.  
   - Toggle between augmented, original, or a hybrid dataset combining both, with targeted sampling to ensure class balance during training.
- **Error analysis:**  
  - Weak performance on ‚ÄúLow‚Äù dosage class traced to limited real samples; added diverse synthetic low-dosage cases to improve class balance.  
  - Noticed a period where synthetic data boosted training performance but caused degradation on real medical data, highlighting the need for higher-quality, clinically valid synthetic samples.

## üß† Key Insights

- Quantization is critical for running LLMs in GPU-constrained setups.
- Removing diagnosis (`mild`, `moderate`, `servere`) tokens hurts augmented dataset performance but slightly boosts accuracy on real clinical data.
- Dataset balancing improves model handling of underrepresented classes like ‚ÄúLow‚Äù dosage.
- Synthetic data quality directly impacts real data performance; poorly controlled synthetic augmentation can harm real-world accuracy, necessitating stricter validation of synthetic samples.
